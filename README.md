* [mmtools](https://andreassommer.github.io/mmtools "Miscellaneous Matlab Tools")
  \- Collection of matlab tools  
  \- msession: manage Matlab session (storing and retrieving of open files, variables, globals, etc)  
  \- optionlists: handling name-value pairs in function calls.  
  \- integrate_with_restarts: convenience driver for forward integration of implicitly switched ODEs with state jumps  
  \- roundto: round to nearest integer divisor  
  \- many many more nice tools

* [cle2e](https://github.com/andreassommer/cle2e "Extract images from Heidelberg OCT files")
